# Linear Regression

This is a implementation of linear regression using the gradient descent
algorithm. The project was inspired from a youtube video, "How to Do Linear
Regression the Right Way" by Siraj Raval.

This algorithm is just an illustration of gradient descent in finding the best
line fit for a set of data and not the most optimal way to do linear regression.
The output is the best approximation rather than the actual result. The script
is not optimized for speed and takes time to arrive at an output.

The script uses the same data set as used by Siraj, and please view the attached
licenses to know the copyright conditions stated by the original author.
The data set contains the number of hours students spent studying and their
test scores.

The implementation is from scratch and uses the universal concept of calculus
to solve for the best line fitting the data points.

The script is dependent on the numpy module for vector operation and will work
on both python 2 and python 3. Other than numpy, it uses sys module to
fetch the command line argument.

We will find the optimum value for the slop and y intercept. The starting point
for both will be 0. After n number of iterations we will get the optimum values.
